# VGA on Uno


i know there is a vga lib, but there was not enough memory space to play bad apple



so i used this one: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/dhruvw221/arduino-video-game-with-vga-video-output-789f9f?f=1



And I used the after-effect to reduce the size and calculate the difference between frames.![a (20)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44233195/151503321-ef807adf-53db-4dba-9d65-e4772fcde5f3.png)

And I calculated the distance between the difference values and made it into an arrangement. (i used python)

By compressing it like this, about 300 frames of 40x30 black and white images were put in 32 kb.
